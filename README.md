### Hello World and Calculator
**Experiment 1**

**AIM -**
To Print "Hello World" and program a simple calculator in C++

### Theory

C++ is a general-purpose, high-performance programming language that builds on the foundation of the C language. Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979. C++ is a cross-platform language used to create high-performance applications. It supports object-oriented programming.

This experiment consists of two practicals namely printing of `"Hello World"` and making of simple calculator program.

### Experiment 1 A: Hello World - 
In the hello world program , the `cout` function from the iostream library is used to print output. The iostream library in C++ is a library for input and output operations.

### Experiment 1 B: Simple Calculator - 
Arithmetic operators`(+,-,/,*)` were used to create calculator program and `cin` function is used to receive inputs from the user.
